Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of Linux applications inside software containers
Quote of features from Docker web pages
Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run code runtime system tools system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server
This guarantees that it will always run the same regardless of the environment it is running in 
Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux
Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces and a union-capable file system such as aufs and others to allow independent containers to run within a single Linux instance avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines 
The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly isolates an application's view of the operating environment including process trees network user IDs and mounted file systems while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting including the CPU memory block I/O and network
Since version 0.9 Docker includes the libcontainer library as its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt LXC Linux Containers and systemd-nspawn
